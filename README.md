## Roadmap and Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty division, reflecting typical competitive programming tiers:

- **Bronze Level:** Basic problems focusing on fundamental concepts and straightforward algorithms.
- **Silver Level:** Intermediate problems introducing more complex data structures and algorithmic patterns.
- **Gold Level:** Challenging problems requiring deeper insight, advanced algorithms, and optimization.
- **Platinum Level:** Highly complex problems involving sophisticated techniques and in-depth analysis.

Future improvements include:

- Tagging problems by algorithm categories such as greedy, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, binary search, etc.
- Adding direct links to problem statements for quick access.
- Including markdown explanations alongside code to provide additional context and learning material.
